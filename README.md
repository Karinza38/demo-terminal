# README

Repository containing code to script updatecli demo.
It relies on [saschagrunert/demo](https://github.com/saschagrunert/demo) to describe the different steps of our demo.

## Record

To record our video, we need to use a third tool such as:
* [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)
* [Terminalizer](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer)
* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
* [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs)

This repository uses a Makefile to easily execute the different demos, more information on `make help`

**Convert video to gif**
`ffmpeg -i input_video_file output.gif`
